                <p>
                    We started Same Daylivery to solve a massive painpoint for small businesses who sell consumer products. We wanted to create a simple way for small businesses to offer not only same-day delivery but also delivery in a matter of a few hours to their customers after they placed their order.




                </p>
                <p>
                    Polls, surveys and statistics show that not only to consumers value same-day delivery (and obviously delivery in just a few hours) but they are more than happy to pay a few extra dollars for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This made us realize that we can offer this service to small businesses in hundreds of metro areas and that businesses can not only make the money that they pay us back but also even potentially make a profit by marking up this deliver option to their customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also realized that we don't need large warehouses in each metro area. We just needed a place in each metro area that was secure and climate-controlled in order to hold the inventory. So we settled on renting our regular climate-controlled storage units in each metro area.

                    Same Daylivery was officially born in November 2021.
