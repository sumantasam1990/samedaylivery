            <p class="fs-4 mt-4">
                From everyone at Same Daylivery, thank you for using our product! We build them to help you do your best work.  Because we don’t know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.

                When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to Same Daylivery.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-3 fs-4">
                When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by Same Daylivery, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.

                When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.

                We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an expanded related policy.

                When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That’s true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.

                If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account.
            </p>

                USING SAME DAYLIVERY
            </h4>
            <p class="mt-4 fs-4">
                You may only create and hold one account on each of the separately branded properties on the Platforms (each, an “Account”) for your personal use. You may have another Account if you are using the Platform for business purposes, including as part of an enterprise Account, pursuant to a separate agreement with Same Daylivery. In consideration of the use of the Platform and the Services, you agree that you are able to create a binding legal obligation with Same Daylivery, and you also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you provide to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.<br>

                The Platform may permit you to use the Services without an Account or without logging in to your Account (e.g. on our in-store kiosks or as a guest with our group order feature). If you use the Service in this manner, we may create an Account for you based on the information you provide to us in connection with the transaction (e.g., your payment information, name, phone number, email address, and other transaction information). If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Platform, and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to this Agreement prior to your using the Platform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are not authorized to use the Platform or otherwise access the Services if you are under the age of 13. If you are using the Platform on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that entity, organization, or company. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, including, without limitation, having an invalid or expired payment method on file, or if Same Daylivery has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Same Daylivery has the right to block your current or future use of the Platform and/or the Services (or any portion thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement with you. If your Account is terminated for any or no reason, you may forfeit any pending, current, or future account credits, Perks (defined below) or other promotional offers, and any other forms of unredeemed value in or associated with your Account without prior notice to you. <br>

                You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account including your password and, if applicable, any password for Facebook, Google, or other third party login. You are also responsible for all activities or any other actions that occur under or that are taken in connection with your Account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify Same Daylivery of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including, without limitation, loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. Same Daylivery will not be liable for any injury, loss, or damage of any kind arising from or relating to your failure to comply with (a) and/or (b) or for any acts or omissions by you or someone else who is using your Account and/or password. <br>

                COMMUNICATIONS & TEXT MESSAGES
            </h4>
            <p class="mt-4 fs-4">
                When you use the Services, or send emails, text messages, and other communications from your desktop or mobile device to us, you may be communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically, such as e-mails, texts, mobile push notices, or notices and messages through the Services, and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. <br>

                Your voluntary provision to Same Daylivery of your cell phone number represents your consent that Same Daylivery may contact you by telephone, SMS, or MMS messages at that phone number, and your consent to receiving such communications for transactional, operational, or informational purposes. When you provide your phone number to Same Daylivery, you warrant that you are the current subscriber or authorized user of the relevant account. You understand and agree that such messages may be sent using automated technology. You may unsubscribe from receiving text messages from Same Daylivery at any time. To revoke your consent to receiving SMS or MMS messages from Same Daylivery, you agree to follow the unsubscribe procedures described below. <br>

                When placing orders through the Platform, you may receive order status messages from Same Daylivery about each order. To unsubscribe from order-related messages, just reply "STOP" to the number sending the message. To resubscribe, text “START” to the same number from the phone number associated with your account. If you need assistance, text “HELP”. Please note that unsubscribing from one of the branded properties in our Platform will not automatically unsubscribe you from another separately branded property in our Platform. For example, if you unsubscribe from Same Daylivery order-related messages, you may still receive order-related messages when you place an order through Seamless, unless you also unsubscribe from Seamless order-related messages. <br>

                Additionally, you may receive messages from Same Daylivery following receipt of a completed order soliciting feedback and/or other information relating to the order. You may unsubscribe from all such feedback messages by replying "STOP" to the number sending the feedback messages. To resubscribe, text "START" to the number sending the feedback messages using the phone number associated with your account. Please note that unsubscribing from such feedback texts will not prevent you from receiving texts from Same Daylivery, the Restaurant, or your delivery person regarding your order or its delivery unless you also text "STOP" to the number sending the order-related messages, and even in such event, you may still receive individual texts from the Restaurant or your delivery person to enable successful delivery of your order. <br>

                You may also receive text messages in response to certain Customer Care requests. To unsubscribe from Customer Care messages, just reply to the message by texting “STOP” to the number sending the message. <br>

                If you unsubscribe from receiving text messages from Same Daylivery through the process described above, you may continue to receive text messages for a short period while Same Daylivery processes your request(s). If you change or deactivate the phone number you provided to Same Daylivery, you have an affirmative obligation to immediately update your account information and the phone number(s) attached to your account to prevent us from inadvertently communicating with anyone who acquires any phone number(s) previously attributed to you, and any new phone number(s) you attach to your account may receive Same Daylivery's standard SMS or MMS messages unless you also unsubscribe via the above procedures. <br>

                Standard data and message rates may apply for SMS and MMS alerts, whether you send or receive such messages. Please contact your mobile phone carrier for details. <br>
